      <h2>Family:</h2>
      <p>My name is Luke Banner. I was born in 2003 to my parents Andrea Banner and Justin Banner. They met in 2000 at BYU, and were married about a year later. I am the first of 2 children. I have a younger brother named Jace, who is currently 19 years old and serving a mission in Bolivia. I also have a pet Dachshund named Remington, who is about 11 years old. I was born in Indiana, but have grown up in Utah with my family since I was about 2.</p>

      <h2>Academics:</h2>
      <h3>Elementary:</h3>
      <p>I first attended Elementary School at Legacy Elementary in Highland, Utah. I was a relatively gifted student, reading well above my grade level and doing advanced math. In 3rd grade my parents decided to send me to a private school for a better education, American Heritage. I was there from 3rd grade through 6th grade. It was a very well-organized school with a heavy emphasis on religion which my parents and I greatly appreciated.</p>

      <h3>Junior High:</h3>
      <p>After that I went back to public school at American Fork Junior High. I was in the advanced math classes my entire junior high school experience, and took advanced English, History, and Science in 8th and 9th grade as well. I wasn’t quite a 4.0 student but my grades were generally very solid. I also participated in our school’s mock trial team all three years of junior high.</p>

      <h3>High School and College:</h3>
      <p>In high school, I continued in honors courses and ended up taking four AP classes and scoring two 4s and three 5s on my five AP tests. I scored a 1450 on the SAT (the equivalent of a 33 on the ACT), and maintained a GPA right around 3.9. I again participated in Mock Trial my senior year, where we made it all the way to the state finals. I also played football and threw shot put and discus during high school. I was accepted into BYU on scholarship and did a year there (with a somewhat lower GPA, since I needed to learn how to study) before serving my mission in <em><strong>Washington DC South!</strong></em></p>

      <h2>Mission:</h2>
      <h3>My Own Journey:</h3>
      <p>I began my mission in October of 2022, and let me just say, it was a <strong>ROUGH</strong> transition. I wasn’t very certain of my testimony, and I was really anxious about everything a mission would entail. I really didn’t want to go, but it kind of felt like I had to. My first two months were brutal, but after a lot of prayer and fasting, and really making the commitment to try, I began to finally see light at the end of the tunnel. Suddenly my mission felt very possible, and I finally began to understand faith. I went from not really even believing in God to coming to know Him personally, and knowing that He knew and loved me.</p>

      <h3>Converts:</h3>
      <p>I was blessed to meet and work with some incredible people on my mission. There are a few standouts. The first is Seth, a man adopted from Romania who had met missionaries in Pennsylvania but moved back to Virginia in time to be baptized. He’s endured a lot of trials, both physically and emotionally, but he’s really dived into the gospel and it’s been amazing to see. I flew out for his endowment about a month ago. The other one I’ll mention is Joe. Joe was an ordained Catholic priest when he met missionaries, and I had the privilege of teaching him for almost six months. He moved out to Utah and was baptized, giving up his home, livelihood, and everything he ever knew because he received such powerful witnesses from the Spirit through the Book of Mormon. Truly an inspiring story, and I was grateful to be a part of it.</p>
